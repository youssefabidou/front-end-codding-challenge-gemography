# Front-end Coding Challenge

## Idea of the App 
The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. 
You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API (Github API explained down below). 

## Technologies used and why
- Angular : I chose angular because I'm familiar with and it has a detailed documentation and a large community that can help others 
- Angular material : Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular JS developers. Angular Material components
  help in constructing && to get the data from Github 
).

## How to run the app
- Clone the project with the commande line :
  git clone https://github.com/youssefabidou/front-end-codding-challenge-gemography.git .

- Install npm with the command line :
  npm install npm -g

- Install Angular CLI at the global level on your machine with the command line :
  npm install -g @angular/cli

- Get into the project file with the command line :
  cd name-of-the-app

 - run the app with the command line :
 ng serve
